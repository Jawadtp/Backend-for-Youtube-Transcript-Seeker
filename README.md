# Backend-for-Youtube-Transcript-Seeker

A web application with Flask backend that searches transcripts of YouTube videos/playlists for specified key term.
This is implemented using <a href="https://github.com/SinadShan/Yoogle">Yoogle</a> which is a Python script that achieves the aforementioned task.
Kudos to my friend <a href="https://github.com/SinadShan">Sinadin Shan</a> for this extremely purposeful script!
